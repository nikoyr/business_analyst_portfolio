## Project #1 - NBA Most Valuable Player 

**Description:** This is a project that I did to learn more about how to get raw data from the web and then clean it. It also includes some data visualization along with machine learning. 
The goal was to scrape NBA player statistics and then extract data that can be applied to forecast the Most Valuable Players (MVP) for the season. This project can be further used to explore the data either by visualizing it or by applying other machine learning models.
Here are links to the notebooks in this project:

This notebook starts the project by scraping the NBA data of the web.

[Data cleaning](https://github.com/nikoyr/business_analyst_portfolio/blob/main/Python/NBA_MVP/nba_data_cleaning.ipynb)

Here we clean the data scraped in the previous notebook.

Lastly, the data is used in machine learning models to predict MVP award winners.

All these files can also be found in the [NBA_MVP project file](https://github.com/nikoyr/business_analyst_portfolio/tree/main/Python/NBA_MVP), along with csv-files of the data.
